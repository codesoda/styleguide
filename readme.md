# Styleguide++

[@bbatsov](https://github.com/bbatsov) has done an awesome job in convening the [Ruby on Rails style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide#activerecord). If you are using it, you should also run [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)/[houndci](https://houndci.com/) during builds.

These are a few of my personal preferences/templates for new(’ish) files.

## TODOS
- [ ] Create gem/template script so I can override rails generators.

## Models
- [Model.rb](/model.rb): I’ve created this model so I can quickly drop the layout into new models.
